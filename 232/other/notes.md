When setting dp state to:
dp(a,b) = prob. that p2 wins if p1 has a points, p2 has b points, and it is p1's turn.
it didn't work.

Changing dp state to:
dp(a,b) = prob. that p2 wins if p1 has a points, p2 has b points, and it is p2's turn.
it does work.

But imo, they are equivalent. Not sure what the difference is.
